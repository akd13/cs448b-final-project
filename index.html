        What makes TED talks popular?
      </h2>
      <p id="text-page-content">
        Over the past decade and a half or so, TED talks have increasingly grown in popularity. 
        With the most popular TED talk of all times, having more than 76 million views. We are 
        looking to understand what makes TED talks popular (for the purposes of this article, we will refer to a talk as more 
        popular if it has more views). <br> <br>

        To answer our question, we will be guiding you through three different interactive visualizations, each one digging a 
        little deeper into what factors contribute to the popularity of TED talks over time. <br> <br>

        The dataset we have chosen has information about over 2400+ TED talks from 2006-2017. <br> <br>

        TED talks across the globe are originally recorded in English, but captions can be provided in multiple languages and for some talks in our data, 
        this number is as high as 66. This makes us wonder if there is a correlation between the number of languages a TED talk is 
        available in and its popularity? <br> <br>

        Our first visualization looks at this question - the bigger the radius of the circle, the more views a talk has and the darker the 
        color of the circle, the more languages it is available in. The speakers in our dataset are global citizens, hailing from 84 
        unique countries, and therefore, we also allow filtering by birthplace of the speaker of the talk for those interested in the 
        granularities.
