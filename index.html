        Is the fate of your TED talk beyond your control? Your background matters!
      </h2>
      <p id="text-page-content">
        A blogger and an actor deliver TED talks. Which one do you think would be more 
        popular (and garner more views)? Think again, because you might not have guessed correctly the first time. <br> <br>

        Over the past decade and a half, TED talks have increasingly grown in popularity, with the most-viewed TED talk 
        of all time having more than 76 million views. While much has been spoken about how to make one’s TED talk 
        popular, we want to explore whether part of the fate of your talk might have been decided much earlier. <br> <br>

        Our backgrounds play an extremely pivotal role in shaping us, and we want to examine whether different aspects of 
        your background can impact the popularity of your TED talk. <br> <br>

        To answer our question, we will guide you through three different interactive visualizations, each one delving 
        into a different aspect of the speaker’s background - Professional Background, Geographical Background, 
        and Emotional Background. <br> <br> 
        
        The dataset we have chosen contains information about TED talks from 2006-2017. <br> <br>
