        Is the fate of your TED talk beyond your control? Your background matters!
      </h2>
      <p id="text-page-content">
        A British blogger turned comedian and a popular Bollywood actor deliver TED talks. Which one do you think would be more
        popular, and garner more views? Think again, because you might not have guessed correctly the first time. <br> <br>

        Answer: it is the blogger. <br> <br>

        Over the past decade and a half, TED talks have increasingly grown in popularity, with the most-viewed TED talk 
        of all time having more than 76 million views. While much has been spoken about the key to delivering a successful
        TED talk - pick a good topic, keep it simple, tell a story - not much has been explored about inherent aspects of the speaker that drive views.
        We want to explore whether part of the fate of a TED talk might have been decided even before it is delivered. <br> <br>

        Our backgrounds play an extremely pivotal role in shaping us, and we want to examine whether different aspects of 
        one's background can impact the popularity of their TED talk. <br> <br>

        To answer our question, we will guide you through three different interactive visualizations, each one delving 
        into a different aspect of the speakerâ€™s background - Professional Background, Geographical Background, 
        and Emotional & Cultural Background. <br> <br>
        <em>Note: The dataset we have chosen contains information about TED talks from 2006-2017, so some of the data might not reflect the most recent trends. <br> <br></em>
