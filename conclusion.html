          Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p id="text-page-content">
        From the scatterplot, we see that the line of best fit's slope for terms like Fascinating, Inspiring, etc for both regions
        is a lot steeper than that for negative terms like "Obnoxious", "Longwinded" and "Confusing". Surprisingly, "Obnoxious" does better than "Longwinded" in terms of correlation between views and ratings -
        anything that elicits a strong view garners more views!

        <br> <br>
        There is a stronger correlation for terms like "Funny" and "Persuasive" compared to "Beautiful", "Courageous" and "Informative".
        This indicates that talks evoking strong positive emotions are more likely to gain popularity than those receiving milder positive feedback,
        or outright negative feedback.
