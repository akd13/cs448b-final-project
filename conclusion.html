          Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p id="text-page-content">
        From the scatterplot, we see that the line of best fit's slope for terms like Fascinating, Inspiring, etc for both regions
        is a lot steeper than that for negative terms like Ok, Obnoxious, Longwinded and Confusing. We also notice that the line of best fit
        is better for terms like "Fascinating", "Inspiring", etc than for terms like "Beautiful", "Courageous", "Informative", etc.
        This indicates that talks evoking strong positive emotions are more likely to gain popularity than those receiving milder positive feedback,
        or outright negative feedback.
        <br> <br>
        Interestingly, the analysis also reveals regional differences in how ratings influence popularity. The line of best fit
        for positive ratings is notably different for the Americas than for Europe, implying that in the Americas, positively
        rated talks have a higher tendency to attract viewers. This disparity could be attributed to cultural variations in
        content preference or the influence of regional media trends. We also acknowledge the larger volume of talks originating
        from the Americas that could skew this trend, suggesting a potential volume bias in the data.
        <br> <br>
        In conclusion, we see that the number of languages a talk is available in does not significantly impact its popularity. However,
        the ratings of a talk do impact its popularity, and ratings that are more positive (on the "extreme" side) are more likely to be
        associated with popular talks. These insights underline the importance of content that resonates deeply with audiences in
        determining the success, which is, the number of views, that a TED talk receives!
