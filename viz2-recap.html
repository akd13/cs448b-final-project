        From the previous visualisation, we see that the cities with the highest bars, a.k.a those that are most popular,
        are concentrated in and around North America and Europe - specifically, the U.K. <br> <br>

      This a revelation! It is sensible to think that the most populous countries, India and China, will have a lot more speakers,
          and a lot more viewers for their talks.
        However, the real spark lies in the media hubs of North America and the U.K, while cities in Asia, Africa and Oceania
          are not as popular. A notable exception is capital cities and financial hubs.<br> <br>

        These are the places where the most popular TED speakers come from.
          <br> <br>
          We next explore the cultural background of the speakers.
          Is how they are perceived important to their TED talk's success?  <br> <br>
          Is an "annoying" speaker's fate already decided even before they talk?<br> <br>
