        From the previous visualization, we see that the talks with the highest bars, a.k.a those that are most popular
        are concentrated in and around North America and Europe. This is not surprising, as English is the native language
        in these regions, and they are key hubs for popular media, contributing to higher viewership.

        We also acknowledge that these regions also have the most number of talks in our dataset - as TED itself is an American-Canadian foundation,
        with the founder and the current curator having origins in Britain, it is obvious that these regions will hold greater influence.
        <br> <br>

        Given this regional concentration, it's logical to delve deeper into talks from these areas to understand what factors drive their popularity,
        and further breakdown if there are factors that drive views. <br> <br>
        While our analysis suggests that the number of languages a talk is translated into doesn't significantly impact views,
        we haven't yet explored the role of ratings. Do talks with higher positive ratings (e.g., labeled as 'ingenious' or 'funny')
        attract more views? Conversely, how do talks with less favorable ratings fare? <br><br>
