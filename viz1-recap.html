        From the previous visualization, we see that some very popular talks are available in more languages than the average 
        talk, but so are some talks that are not as popular. We also see that most talks are available in around 10 languages.
        Another factor to consider is when languages were added for a talk, was it immediately after it was released or once it 
        started to gain some popularity? We unfortunately cannot answer this as we do not have the data for this. <br> <br>


        The country filter, however, shows us the stark difference in the birthplace of speakers. Not just this, but the talks 
        of speakers from smaller, lesser known countries are not as popular as ones from bigger, more well known countries. 
        But what about what things look at a more micro level? At the city level instead of the country. <br> <br>

        Our next visualization provides us with information at the city level. The longer the red bar is, the more average views 
        talks of speakers born in those cities have. <br> <br>
