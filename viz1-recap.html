        As we see, there most definitely is a correlation between a speaker's profession and the popularity of their TED talk.
        While there might not be as stark of a difference between all the occupation clusters (except the first 1-2), digging into the
        occupation clusters shows a great difference. Consider the average views of a life coach (20M) vs. a spiritual 
        leader (0.5M)!<br> <br>
        Given this correlation, we now want to dig into birthplaces of the speakers - their geographical background. Ranging from
        New York to Nairobi to New Delhi, speakers born and raised from all over the world deliver TED talks. <br> <br>

        Do certain places generate more popular speakers? Or is it a more even distribution? <br> <br>
